However, some good points have \nbecome clear.\n\nAs far as I can tell, every member of the beta\nis following a different quest chain. I have not\nseen anyone else doing the same actions or\ngetting the same rewards.\n\nI can only speculate that they have managed\nto procedurally generate quests that feel like\nthey were written by a real person, albiet one\nwith a desperate need for more originality.\n\nThe fact that these quests all include different\nreal-world actions only increase the admiration\nI have for this acheivement.\n\nThe graphics and integration with the world\nalso continue to amaze.
